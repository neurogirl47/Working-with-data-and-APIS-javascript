I knew today you'd say that you could not stay
That you'd tell me you really need to go
It's all the same. You're late. You gotta board a plane
But there's something you really need to know


Each time you walk out that door
I'm here crying on the floor
I can't take this any more


You leave me so easily
To keep going overseas
You love abroad much more than me
